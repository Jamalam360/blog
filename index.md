Hey!

I don't know how or why you got here, but this is my blog (shocking I know!). I'm using it to rant about random things related to software development, I really just need a place to go on random rambles about random things without having to take up an entire Discord channel (I've been banished to a thread now). Wish me luck!

You can find my main portfolio [here](https://jamalam.tech/), if for any reason you would want to see that.
