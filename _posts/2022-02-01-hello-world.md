## Hello World!

It seems I have managed to generate a blog post! I used [this](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) (I've also added Disqus for comments) and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/Jamalam360/blog), if anybody actually cares. I was considering naming this 'Jamablog' but I'm not sure if that's a good idea - seems like the kind of thing that will make me cringe when I look back on it (isn't that most things, though?).

What am I going to write about? Who knows. Probably just random things that interest me - I'm not expecting this to exactly be popular or anything, I just like writing about cool things (it also helps me understand them better).

So, uh, goodbye for now! Perhaps I'll write something soon, maybe I'll just forget about this entirely.
